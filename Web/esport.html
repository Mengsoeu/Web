                            North America is finally back at the top of competitive Valorant.

                            OpTic Gaming are the Masters Reykjavik champions, sweeping Brazilian squad LOUD 3-0 in the
                            grand final of the first international Valorant LAN event of the year.

                            The monumental victory marks OpTic’s first Masters event win in Valorant, and North
                            America’s second international LAN championship following Sentinels’ perfect run at Masters
                            Reykjavik last year.

                            The boys in green were unstoppable as they went on an undefeated 6-0 win streak, after a
                            shaky start that saw them drop to the lower bracket with a group stage loss to Thai team
                            XERXIA Esports.

                            OpTic also proved that they are the masters of rematches, displaying an ability to adapt and
                            learn from every loss. They successfully got their revenge against XERXIA Esports, The
                            Guard, and LOUD, all teams that they had lost to either during the VCT NA Stage 1
                            Challengers playoffs or in Iceland.

                            Team Vitality has won the BLAST Paris Major, beating GamerLegion 2-0 in the grand final in
                            Paris earlier today. The win is the first Major title for Vitality, and will see them go
                            down in history as the last-ever CS:GO world champions, as the game is set to be replaced by
                            Counter-Strike 2 later this year.

                            The final kicked off on Overpass and Vitality quickly showed that they were ready to play.
                            They eased to a dominant 16-6 win and never looked troubled by GamerLegion, setting up match
                            point for what was effectively the home team.

                            Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. The game
                            was first released for PlayStation 4 and Windows in July 2015, with ports for Xbox One and
                            Nintendo Switch being released later on. In June 2016, 505 Games began distributing a
                            physical retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with Warner Bros. Interactive
                            Entertainment taking over those duties by the end of 2017. Versions for macOS and Linux were
                            also released in 2016, but support for their online services were dropped in 2020. The game
                            went free-to-play in September 2020 when Epic Games took ownership.

                            Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars", Rocket League has up to eight players
                            assigned to each of the two teams, using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their
                            opponent's goal and score points over the course of a match. The game includes single-player
                            and multiplayer modes that can be played both locally and online, including cross-platform
                            play between all versions. Later updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core
                            rules and added new game modes, including ones based on ice hockey and basketball.

                            The exciting 1-month action of LoL Worlds 2023 has reached its peak with T1 facing off
                            against Weibo Gaming. T1 had to make it through the LPL gauntlet throughout the World
                            Champinoship to take home the Summoner's Cup.

                            Faker and T1 continue their solid streak against LPL teams at any World Championship as they
                            manage to win the World Championship on home soil.
                            Going into the Finals, T1 only had to beat one final LPL team. Already having taken down BLG
                            during the Swiss Stage, LNG and JDG in the playoffs and finally, WBG.

                            The first and second game were won on the back of the youngest member Choi "Zeus" Woo-je who
                            had been critizised previously for his weak play in other finals. But it seems that the gold
                            medal at the Asian Games helped him regain his confidence to carry T1.

                            but
                            then after that they were better.

                            the
                            game we came back and had some good opportunities. Reguilon, very good chance. The offside
                            goal.
                            So yes in the end we fought back but we need to do this over a whole game.

                            On workrate of the team tonight: "You could say we defended quite well [as per the
                            statistics],
                            but I prefer for us to stay further away from our goal. I'd prefer us to have more of the
                            ball
                            and play in their half. We had our moments where we could make good movements but it was not
                            enough. We need to be more dominant in a game.

                            On uncertainty between goalkeeper and defence: "In the start there were a few situations,
                            but
                            they picked it up and it worked well.

                            On travel issues before the game: "You have to deal with that, it can never be an excuse."
