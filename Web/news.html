                            Osaka was traditionally considered Japan's economic hub. By the Kofun period (300–538) it

                            briefly as the imperial capital. Osaka continued to flourish during the Edo period
                            (1603–1867) and became known as a center of Japanese culture. Following the Meiji
                            Restoration, Osaka greatly expanded in size and underwent rapid industrialization. In 1889,
                            Osaka was officially established as a municipality. The construction boom accelerated
                            population growth throughout the following decades, and by the 1900s, Osaka was the
                            industrial hub in the Meiji and Taishō periods. Osaka made noted contributions to
                            redevelopment, urban planning and zoning standards in the postwar period, the city developed
                            rapidly as one of the major financial centers in the Keihanshin Metropolitan Area.

                            Osaka is a major financial center of Japan, and it is recognized as one of the most
                            multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in Japan. The city is home to the Osaka Exchange as
                            well as the headquarters of multinational electronics corporations such as Panasonic and
                            Sharp. Osaka is an international center of research and development and is represented by
                            several major universities, notably Osaka University, Osaka Metropolitan University, and
                            Kansai University. Famous landmarks in the city include Osaka Castle, Osaka Aquarium
                            Kaiyukan, Dōtonbori, Tsūtenkaku in Shinsekai, Tennōji Park, Abeno Harukas, Sumiyoshi Taisha
                            Grand Shrine, and Shitennō-ji, one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Japan.

                            Rome (Italian and Latin: Roma [ˈroːma] ⓘ) is the capital city of Italy. It is also the
                            capital of the Lazio region, the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, and a special
                            comune named Comune di Roma Capitale. With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq
                            mi),[2] Rome is the country's most populated comune and the third most populous city in the
                            European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome, with a
                            population of 4,355,725 residents, is the most populous metropolitan city in Italy.[3] Its
                            metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy.[4] Rome is located in the
                            central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of
                            the Tiber. Vatican City (the smallest country in the world)[5] is an independent country
                            inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city.
                            Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location, and
                            also as the "Eternal City".[6] Rome is generally considered to be the cradle of Western
                            civilization and Western Christian culture, and the centre of the Catholic Church.[7][8][9]

                            The Golden Bridge (Vietnamese: Cầu Vàng) is a 150-metre-long (490 ft) pedestrian bridge in
                            the Bà Nà Hills resort, near Da Nang, Vietnam.[1][2] It is designed to connect the cable car
                            station with the gardens (avoiding a steep incline)[3] and to provide a scenic overlook and
                            tourist attraction. The bridge loops nearly back around to itself, and has two giant hands,
                            constructed of fibreglass and wire mesh, designed to appear like stone hands that support
                            the structure.

                            The client for the project was the Sun Group.[3] The bridge was designed by TA Landscape
                            Architecture (under Ho Chi Minh City University of Architecture) based in Ho Chi Minh City.
                            The company's founder, Vu Viet Anh, was the project's principal designer, with Trần Quang
                            Hùng as the bridge designer and Nguyen Quang Huu Tuan as the bridge's design manager.
                            Construction began in July 2017 and was completed in April 2018.[4] The bridge opened in
                            June 2018.[5][6]

                            A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. The
                            particles composing a beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle,
                            pebbles, etc., or biological sources, such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. Sediments
                            settle in different densities and structures, depending on the local wave action and
                            weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or layers of material.

                            Though some beaches form on inland freshwater locations such as lakes and rivers, most
                            beaches are in coastal areas where wave or current action deposits and reworks sediments.
                            Erosion and changing of beach geologies happens through natural processes, like wave action
                            and extreme weather events. Where wind conditions are correct, beaches can be backed by
                            coastal dunes which offer protection and regeneration for the beach. However, these natural
                            forces have become more extreme due to climate change, permanently altering beaches at very
                            rapid rates. Some estimates describe as much as 50 percent of the earth's sandy beaches
                            disappearing by 2100 due to climate-change driven sea level rise.[1]

                            Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag speaking to BBC Match of the Day: "We have to give
                            credit to
                            Newcastle, they played better than us tonight. We started well, had a chance with Garnacho,
                            but
                            then after that they were better.

                            "For a long period they were better than us, and we went 1-0 down. To be fair at the end of
                            the
                            game we came back and had some good opportunities. Reguilon, very good chance. The offside
                            goal.
                            So yes in the end we fought back but we need to do this over a whole game.

                            On workrate of the team tonight: "You could say we defended quite well [as per the
                            statistics],
                            but I prefer for us to stay further away from our goal. I'd prefer us to have more of the
                            ball
                            and play in their half. We had our moments where we could make good movements but it was not
                            enough. We need to be more dominant in a game.

                            On uncertainty between goalkeeper and defence: "In the start there were a few situations,
                            but
                            they picked it up and it worked well.

                            On travel issues before the game: "You have to deal with that, it can never be an excuse."

                            "For a long period they were better than us, and we went 1-0 down. To be fair at the end of
                            the
                            game we came back and had some good opportunities. Reguilon, very good chance. The offside
                            goal.
                            So yes in the end we fought back but we need to do this over a whole game.

                            On workrate of the team tonight: "You could say we defended quite well [as per the
                            statistics],
                            but I prefer for us to stay further away from our goal. I'd prefer us to have more of the
                            ball
                            and play in their half. We had our moments where we could make good movements but it was not
                            enough. We need to be more dominant in a game.

                            On uncertainty between goalkeeper and defence: "In the start there were a few situations,
                            but
                            they picked it up and it worked well.

                            On travel issues before the game: "You have to deal with that, it can never be an excuse."
