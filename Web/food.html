                            Tonkatsu (豚カツ, とんかつ or トンカツ, pronounced [toŋkatsɯ]; "pork cutlet") is a Japanese dish that
                            consists of a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet. It involves coating slices of pork with panko
                            (bread crumbs), and then frying them in oil. The two main types are fillet and loin.
                            Tonkatsu is also the basis of other dishes such as katsukarē and katsudon.
                            Tonkatsu originated in Japan during the Meiji Era in the late 19th century, a dish derived
                            from a French dish known as côtelette de veau, a veal cutlet coated in breadcrumbs and fried
                            in a pan with butter.[5]

                            European katsuretsu (loanword/gairaigo for cutlet) was usually made with beef; the pork
                            version was created in 1899 at a restaurant serving European-style foods, named Rengatei in
                            Tokyo, Japan.[6][7][8] It's a type of yōshoku—Japanese versions of European cuisine invented
                            in the late 19th and early 20th centuries—and was called katsuretsu or simply katsu.[9]

                            The soup base depends on the exact sub-type but is generally water, coconut milk, or chicken
                            or other broth.[5]

                            Various aromatic ingredients are sliced, roughly pounded, and simmered to extract their
                            flavor. These include fresh ingredients such as lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, galangal,
                            chilis, shallots, and garlic. For shrimp-based soups, shrimp shells and heads may also be
                            simmered, to extract their flavor. These ingredients are often then removed as their flavor
                            is now extracted and many aren't edible. However they may be left in, as an aid to
                            presentation.[5]

                            Alternatively, commercial tom yum paste may be used. This is made by crushing all the herb
                            ingredients and stir frying in oil, then adding seasoning and other preservative
                            ingredients. The paste is bottled or packaged and sold around the world.

                            Vegetables are then added, such as onion and tomato. In modern popular versions the soup may
                            also contain mushrooms—usually straw mushrooms or oyster mushrooms.[5]

                            A steak is a thick cut of meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, sometimes
                            including a bone. It is normally grilled or fried. Steak can be diced, cooked in sauce, such
                            as in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.

                            Steaks are cut from animals including cattle, bison, buffalo, camel, goat, horse,
                            kangaroo,[1][2] sheep, ostrich, pigs, turkey, and deer, as well as various types of fish,
                            especially salmon and large fish such as swordfish, shark, and marlin. For some meats, such
                            as pork, lamb and mutton, chevon, and veal, these cuts are often referred to as chops. Some
                            cured meat, such as gammon, is commonly served as steak.

                            Grilled portobello mushroom may be called mushroom steak, and similarly for other vegetarian
                            dishes.[3] Imitation steak is a food product that is formed into a steak shape from various
                            pieces of meat. Grilled fruits such as watermelon have been used as vegetarian steak
                            alternatives.

                            Exceptions, in which the meat is sliced parallel to the fibers, include the skirt steak cut
                            from the plate, the flank steak cut from the abdominal muscles, and the silverfinger steak
                            cut from the loin and including three rib bones. In a larger sense, fish steaks, ground meat
                            steaks, pork steak, and many more varieties of steak are known.

                            In the United States, steak cut from cattle is also called "beefsteak".

                            This grilled salmon is coated in a flavorful marinade then grilled until golden brown. A
                            super easy dinner option that will earn you rave reviews! This salmon can also be baked,
                            broiled or pan seared.

                            My grill is one of my favorite cooking devices, I regularly make grilled chicken tenders,
                            steak kabobs and this sweet and savory grilled salmon.
                            There are so many different ways to prepare salmon – it can be baked, broiled, pan seared,
                            steamed, you name it. In my opinion, the best recipe for this fish is grilled salmon,
                            especially when there’s a flavorful marinade involved!

                            then after that they were better.

                            the
                            game we came back and had some good opportunities. Reguilon, very good chance. The offside
                            goal.
                            So yes in the end we fought back but we need to do this over a whole game.

                            On workrate of the team tonight: "You could say we defended quite well [as per the
                            statistics],
                            but I prefer for us to stay further away from our goal. I'd prefer us to have more of the
                            ball
                            and play in their half. We had our moments where we could make good movements but it was not
                            enough. We need to be more dominant in a game.

                            On uncertainty between goalkeeper and defence: "In the start there were a few situations,
                            but
                            they picked it up and it worked well.

                            On travel issues before the game: "You have to deal with that, it can never be an excuse."
