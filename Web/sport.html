                            American football (referred to simply as football in the United States and Canada), also
                            known as gridiron football,[nb 1] is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a
                            rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with possession of the
                            oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing
                            it, while the defense, the team without possession of the ball, aims to stop the offense's
                            advance and to take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least
                            ten yards in four downs or plays; if they fail, they turn over the football to the defense,
                            but if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive. Points
                            are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown
                            or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the
                            most points at the end of a game wins.

                            American football evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of soccer and
                            rugby. The first American football match was played on November 6, 1869, between two college
                            teams, Rutgers and Princeton, using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time. A set of
                            rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp, the "Father of American Football",
                            established the snap, the line of scrimmage, eleven-player teams, and the concept of downs.
                            Later rule changes legalized the forward pass, created the neutral zone and specified the
                            size and shape of the football. The sport is closely related to Canadian football, which
                            evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game, although its rules were
                            developed independently from those of Camp. Most of the features that distinguish American
                            football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football. The two sports are
                            considered the primary variants of gridiron football."

                            Almost one year after Lionel Messi lifted the World Cup trophy for Argentina in Qatar, the
                            Inter Miami CF star revisited the complicated path to the title and expressed his
                            satisfaction at turning criticism into praise in his country.

                            In an interview for the "Champions, a Year Later" special on Disney Star+, Messi said one of
                            his top triumphs from winning the World Cup and Copa América with Argentina is having the
                            "beautiful feeling" of being loved by "95% or 100% of Argentines."
                            Messi made his debut for Argentina in 2005, but his first title in a major tournament came
                            in 2021 after beating Brazil in the Copa América final. In between came some heartbreaking
                            defeats, including ones at the 2011 and 2016 Copa América tournaments and a shocking
                            round-of-16 loss to France at the 2018 World Cup. In the 18 months after winning the Copa
                            América, he led the Albiceleste to the Finalissima trophy at Wembley Stadium in London and
                            the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

                            The Tour de France (French pronunciation: [tuʁ də fʁɑ̃s]; English: Tour of France) is an
                            annual men's multiple-stage bicycle race held primarily in France.[1] It is the oldest of
                            the three Grand Tours (the Tour, the Giro d'Italia, and the Vuelta a España) and is
                            generally considered the most prestigious.

                            The race was first organized in 1903 to increase sales for the newspaper L'Auto[2] and has
                            been held annually since, except when stopped for the two World Wars. As the Tour gained
                            prominence and popularity the race was lengthened and gained more international
                            participation. The Tour is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete
                            in the race are mostly UCI WorldTeams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers
                            invite.[3][4]

                            Traditionally, the bulk of the race is held in July. While the route changes each year, the
                            format of the race stays the same, and includes time trials,[1] passage through the mountain
                            chains of the Pyrenees and the Alps, and a finish on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.[5][6] The
                            modern editions of the Tour de France consist of 21 day-long stages over a 23 or 24 day
                            period and cover approximately 3,500 kilometres (2,200 mi) total.[7] The race alternates
                            between clockwise and counterclockwise circuits.[8]

                            Japan improved to 5-1 in Pool B at Yoyogi National Gymnasium, trailing the United States,
                            which had already booked one of the two spots on offer for Paris after an unbeaten 6-0
                            start.

                            Slovenia and Japan entered Saturday's match with 4-1 records. Even if both finished the pool
                            on Sunday with 5-2 records, the tiebreaker would be decided by whichever team had a better
                            sets-won percentage, which would be Japan by virtue of its 3-0 victory.

                            Japan's captain, Yuki Ishikawa, was the top scorer for his team with 15 points.

                            "Although we found ourselves in really tough situations, we were able to get this result
                            because we fought with belief in ourselves," Ishikawa said. "I think this is the best team
                            we could have had, and we were able to prove our strength to everyone."

                            Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag speaking to BBC Match of the Day: "We have to give
                            credit to
                            Newcastle, they played better than us tonight. We started well, had a chance with Garnacho,
                            but
                            then after that they were better.

                            "For a long period they were better than us, and we went 1-0 down. To be fair at the end of
                            the
                            game we came back and had some good opportunities. Reguilon, very good chance. The offside
                            goal.
                            So yes in the end we fought back but we need to do this over a whole game.

                            On workrate of the team tonight: "You could say we defended quite well [as per the
                            statistics],
                            but I prefer for us to stay further away from our goal. I'd prefer us to have more of the
                            ball
                            and play in their half. We had our moments where we could make good movements but it was not
                            enough. We need to be more dominant in a game.

                            On uncertainty between goalkeeper and defence: "In the start there were a few situations,
                            but
                            they picked it up and it worked well.

                            On travel issues before the game: "You have to deal with that, it can never be an excuse."

                            Newcastle, they played better than us tonight. We started well, had a chance with Garnacho,
                            but
                            then after that they were better.

                            "For a long period they were better than us, and we went 1-0 down. To be fair at the end of
                            the
                            game we came back and had some good opportunities. Reguilon, very good chance. The offside
                            goal.
                            So yes in the end we fought back but we need to do this over a whole game.

                            On workrate of the team tonight: "You could say we defended quite well [as per the
                            statistics],
                            but I prefer for us to stay further away from our goal. I'd prefer us to have more of the
                            ball
                            and play in their half. We had our moments where we could make good movements but it was not
                            enough. We need to be more dominant in a game.

                            On uncertainty between goalkeeper and defence: "In the start there were a few situations,
                            but
                            they picked it up and it worked well.

                            On travel issues before the game: "You have to deal with that, it can never be an excuse."
